		<h2>Honest Review</h2>
		<p>In terms of story i still think the original is told better because literally every character in the original last of us was likeable even the villans and that's not the case here, abby and owen are incredibly unlikable, dina and jessie are alright but they should have been way better, still in my opinion this game is nowhere near as bad as some would make you believe and most of them didn't even gave the game a chance and made up their minds based on the leaks which works for a movie but this is different and you have to experience it for yourself and even if you still hated it, it's understandable like i said the game is very flawed and it's not for everyone like the first game.</p>

		<h1>Honest Review</h1>
		<p>If you are among the few who haven't seen it yet: believe the hype, it really is THAT good. Breaking Bad may not depict reality the way 'Generation Kill' or 'The Wire' did - but then it's not about that, either. From an artistic point of view - performances, writing, direction, camera, music - this show is every bit as good as the other two mentioned above, but unlike those, 'Breaking Bad' just wants to entertain and therefore enjoys a lot more creative freedom.</p>

		<h1>Honest Review</h1>
		<p>Till season 7 very likely the best TV show ever made in terms of suspense, character development, plot, effects, acting.... 10/10 with no doubt! But S6E10 is probably the point where you should stop and imagine your own ending. It is guaranteed better and has more character development. Otherwise you may end up rating it down by more than just one and are overcome by disappointment</p>
